# 🌍 Global Port Efficiency Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project presents an Excel-based interactive dashboard analyzing global port performance using public maritime transport data from UNCTAD (2018–2023). It identifies trends in port turnaround times, vessel modernization, and cargo handling capacity to understand global supply chain efficiency.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze and visualize key maritime metrics — such as median port time, vessel size, and cargo capacity — using Microsoft Excel, and present actionable insights for stakeholders in logistics, trade, and policy.

## 📊 Key Features

- 📅 **Interactive Filtering** by Year and Country using slicers  
- 📈 **Trend Analysis** of Median Port Time (2018–2023)  
- 📦 **Vessel Modernization** insight: Vessel Size vs Port Time  
- 🌐 **Top 10 Countries by Cargo Capacity**  
- 📉 **Efficiency Heatmap** using Conditional Formatting  
- 📊 Charts: Line, Bar, Combo, Scatter, and KPI Cards

---

## ⚙️ Excel Techniques Used

- `AVERAGEIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, `MAXIFS`, `MATCH`  
- PivotTables & Slicers

## 🧠 Insights Extracted

- > 77% of ports in the UK were efficient in 2022 (turnaround < 3 days)  
- Global median port time peaked in 2022 and began improving in 2023  
- Countries with larger average vessels do not always have faster turnaround times  
- Japan and the Netherlands lead in max cargo capacity among container ships
