# 🌍 Global Port Efficiency Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project presents an Excel-based interactive dashboard analyzing global port performance using public maritime transport data from UNCTAD (2018–2023). It identifies trends in port turnaround times, vessel modernization, and cargo handling capacity to understand global supply chain efficiency.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze and visualize key maritime metrics — such as median port time, vessel size, and cargo capacity — using Microsoft Excel, and present actionable insights for stakeholders in logistics, trade, and policy.
