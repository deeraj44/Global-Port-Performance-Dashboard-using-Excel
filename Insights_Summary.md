## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. 🇬🇧 UK Maintains Strong Port Efficiency in 2023
With an average turnaround time of **1.32 days**, and **78%** of port entries classified as efficient (less than 3 days), the UK continues to demonstrate high operational performance in maritime logistics.

### 2. ⏱️ Global Port Delays Peaked in 2022, Then Improved
Median port time globally increased from **1.14 days in 2019** to **1.22 in 2022**, reflecting congestion or post-COVID strain. In 2023, this slightly dropped to **1.19 days**, signaling early signs of recovery.

### 3. 🛳️ Vessel Size Growth Correlates with Port Time Variability
Average vessel size has grown steadily from **~22,000 GT in 2018** to nearly **26,000 GT in 2023**. However, larger vessel size does not guarantee faster port time, as seen in 2022 when both size and delay peaked.

### 4. 📦 Japan and the Netherlands Dominate in Cargo Capacity
According to max DWT values, **Japan**, **the Netherlands**, and **France** lead globally in handling the largest cargo-carrying vessels — highlighting their dominance in maritime infrastructure.

### 5. 📈 Strong Correlation: Cargo Capacity vs Vessel Size
The scatter plot shows a clear positive correlation between **vessel size (GT)** and **cargo capacity (DWT)** — supporting modernization trends in global shipping.
